# Online Retail Data Visualization Project (Forage Project)
## Introduction
Welcome to the Online Retail Data Visualization Project. This project is from the online learning platform Forage, which give you the real world working experience. This project showcases my Power BI data visualization skills by analyzing an Online Retail dataset.
The aim is to clean the data, build meaningful visuals, and provide insights to help business leaders make better decisions about demand, revenue, top customers, and expansion opportunities.
## Background
The Online Retail dataset contains transaction records from an e-commerce store.
It includes details such as invoice numbers, quantities sold, unit prices, countries, and customer IDs.
This dataset helps simulate real-world retail scenarios for practicing data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Business Task
The goal of this project is to analyze sales and demand patterns to support business growth.  
Specifically, the analysis helps:
- Identify seasonal revenue trends to plan inventory and marketing.
- Find the top countries by revenue excluding the UK, for expansion strategy.
- Highlight top customers to focus loyalty and retention efforts.
- Show product demand by country to identify promising new markets.
## Analysis Questions
- What is the monthly revenue trend for 2011?
- Which 10 countries generate the highest revenue, excluding the UK?
- Who are the top 10 customers by revenue?
- Which countries show the greatest demand for products, excluding the UK?
## Prepare
## Process
### Data Exploration
Before starting the analysis, I explored the dataset to understand its structure and identify any data quality issues.
### Data Cleaning
To ensure reliable analysis:
- I removed any rows with Quantity less than 1.
- I removed any rows where Unit Price was below $0.
- I created a new measure for Revenue by multiplying Quantity and Unit Price.
- I applied filters to focus the analysis on valid transactions only.
### Analyze and Share
I use Power BI for data visualization. [Visualizations](Visualizations.md)
